A mod for Space Engineers

The three Freight boxes from the Decorative Pack #2 but with a twist. They now can remember what what inventory items to have and will refill themselves periodically.

These are intended for server admins to add event or quest items. The construction is restricted so that they cannot be built by players.

To "program" them, enable "View in Terminal", add the items and disable "View in Terminal", it will auto-disable after 5 minutes.
The configuration is kept in the Custom Data, where the refresh period can be set (default 20 minuets) The configuration can be copied between Auto Loot Boxes to aid with setup of events.

These boxes should be placed on a grid that players do not have terminal access to e.g. NPC. They will then appear and behave like the standard boxes.

I have not added a G menu for them, just search for "auto"

Supports Concealment.
